The calendar had 24 useful short posts explaining the concept of PSGI and tutorials how to adapt Plack to the existing web applications.\r\n\r\nThe calendar was so successful and it's been considered a canonical reference for many beginners trying to learn Plack and also web framework authors trying to adapt PSGI.\r\n\r\nThe original content is written 3 years ago, and some are a little dated, but I tried to correct it to get up-to-date, and it will be updated as we find errata and get feedbacks from the readers community.\r\n\r\nRaw source code of the book, in Markdown format, is available on [github repository](https://github.com/miyagawa/plack-handbook) under the Creative Commons license.
